# Frontend Environment Variables
# Replace with your actual backend URL from Render

# API Base URL (for production)
# IMPORTANT: Remove /api/v1 from the end - it's now included in the API calls
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://mern-openai-chatbot-3-backend.onrender.com

# For development, leave this empty or set to:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Note: The /api/v1 prefix is now automatically added to all API calls
# So your backend URL should NOT include /api/v1 at the end
